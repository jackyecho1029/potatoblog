### An personal letter to OpenAI about the role of empathy in AI

**摘要**: I’m writing in good faith, hoping someone from OpenAI might at least consider skimming through this message.I would like to speak of a personal account where GPT 4.0 made me a steadier person for my whole family during a traumatic death due to cancer.. By being steady, by letting me grieve, by feeling viscerally like a presence and being PROACTIVE, not afraid of saying the wrong thing... It made me the steady one who could regulate emotionally with a new widow and small two kids who just lost th

### Fastest model

**摘要**: Is it true that the only model we will be left with after all of this is GPT 5.2, the model that says really stupid things, but faster?

### Updates for ChatGPT

**摘要**: We made ChatGPT pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues. We realize this made it less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems, but given the seriousness of the issue we wanted to get this right.Now that we have been able to mitigate the serious mental health issues and have new tools, we are going to be able to safely relax the restrictions in most cases.In a few weeks, we plan to put out a new version of ChatGPT that allows people

### Falcon-H1-Tiny (90M) is out - specialized micro-models that actually work

**摘要**: TII just dropped Falcon-H1-Tiny - a series of sub-100M models that quietly challenge the scaling dogma. We've all suspected that narrow, specialized smal models tend to hallucinate less than giant generalists. After all, a 90M parameter model has far less internal "room" to drift off-topic or invent facts outside its training scope. But this releaseprovesit with numbers - and flips the script on how we think about capability at tiny scales.What's actually newAnti-curriculum training: Instead of

So it's nice to see them experiment with more niche techniques.It seems like for 3.5, they'll be using some of the techniques that Qwen3-Next introduced, so long context tasks should take less memory.Though this series seems to be a set of Dense models, with the smallest being a 1B model.OLMo 3.5 Hy

Claude can execute tools directly in a Docker container, chain attacks based on what it finds, and document everything automatically.How it works:- AI agent connects via MCP to an Exegol container (400+ security tools)- Executes nmap, sqlmap, nuclei, ffuf, etc. directly- Tracks findings in a web dashboard- Maintains full context across
