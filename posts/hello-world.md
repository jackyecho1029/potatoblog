# Hello World! 👋

Welcome to my digital garden.

> "The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now."

I've always wanted a place to document my journey, not just the code I write, but the life I live. **PotatoEcho** is that place.

## Why "PotatoEcho"?

*   **Potato**: Humble, grounded, versatile.
*   **Echo**: Reverbating thoughts, sharing knowledge that bounces back.

This blog is built with:
1.  **Next.js**: For speed.
2.  **Tailwind CSS**: For style.
3.  **Markdown**: For simplicity.

Stay tuned for more!
