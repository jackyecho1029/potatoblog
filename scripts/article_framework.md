# Article Framework: The Sovereign Builder (Sovereign Orchestrator)

## 1. Title/Header Ideas
- **Final Choice**: 《权利位移：为什么 2026 年是“算力调度官”的猎杀时刻？》
- **Subtitle**: 从 Karpathy 的 Agentic 警告到 Codie Sanchez 的平庸生意金矿

## 2. Part 1: Karpathy's Truth - The Coder is Devalued
- **Core Argument**: Traditional coding is "brick production". If you can describe it, the model can print it.
- **New Definition**: "Computing Orchestrator" (算力调度者). 
    - It's not about *how* to write the loop, but *where* to route the task.
    - Focus on: **Goal -> Constraint -> Route -> Verification**.
- **Reframing**: AI isn't an assistant; it's a scalable electricity layer. You are the grid manager.

## 3. Part 2: Codie Sanchez's Hunting Ground - The Boring Business
- **Core Argument**: Modern AI doesn't solve high-tech problems; it automates "high-cost human electricity" in low-tech industries.
- **Qualified Assets**:
    - High-volume human communication (customer service/sales filters).
    - Legacy data-entry workflows (logistics/accounting).
    - Low-trust/high-frequency vetting (insurance/rental).
- **The Alpha**: The profit isn't in the tech, it's in the **Discrepancy (认知差)** between the business's current tech stack and 2026 AI capabilities.

## 4. Part 3: Case Study - The Reddit Complaint Analyzer
- **The "Why"**: How do you find where the "boring money" is? You look for the screaming customers.
- **The Architecture**:
    - **Phase 1: Deep Search** (Reddit API/Scraper)
    - **Phase 2: Signal Extraction** (Categorizing into 4 core threat/pain types: Functional, Psychological, etc.)
    - **Phase 3: Logic Orchestration** (Moving from a prompt to a system that visualizes product-market fit).
- **Outcome**: A dashboard that doesn't just show "data", but "unmet demand".

## 5. Part 4: The Sovereign Take (The "Don't Be Silent" Style)
- **Closing**: Stop competing with the model on tokens; start competing with the world on systems.
- **Actionable Mantra**: "Don't build features, build asset-operating agents."
